Brawl Stage Manager 3.0 - November 16, 2013

Brawl Stage Manager is a program that uses BrawlLib to help you see and
organize the stages, module files, and stage portraits that are installed on
your SD card (or in whatever folder, on whatever device, you use for Brawl
hacks.) It can also add PAT0 entries for expansion stages (with an automated
process) and change certain PAT0 entries (through a special dialog.)

Hint: In the "change directory" dialog, select your SD card and hit OK. If
there are no .pac files in the root of your SD card, the program should jump
to /private/wii/app/RSBE/pf/stage/melee instead, if it exists. (Try using the
"Start in" field in the shortcut properties.) You can also run
BrawlStageManager.exe from the root of your SD card for the same effect.

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:
PageUp:				Go up one stage (focus does not need to be on the stage list)
PageDown:			Go down one stage (focus does not need to be on the stage list)
Tilde (~):			Display PAT0 modification dialog
Left bracket ([):	Replace border around icon (4-pixel margin) with pixels from
					border.png in application folder
Right bracket (]):	Generate a new FrontStname using a custom font

The left side of the window has a list of stage .PAC files in the current
directory; you can change the directory through the Options menu. Choosing a
stage file will display:
	* The filename, root node name, and filesize of the .PAC
	* The filename, internal name, and filesize of the matching .rel file (if it exists)
	  * By default, the program searches for .rel files in ../../module, but
		through the Options menu you can tell the program to search the current
		directory instead.
	* On the upper-right button: the stage ID of the .rel file
	  * This ID should match the ID of the stage you're replacing; if it doesn't,
		the button will turn red. (If the program doesn't know what ID your .rel file
		should have due to an unrecognized .pac name, the button will turn beige.)
	* Any MSBin nodes in the .pac file, starting with the last (shown by default)
	  * Some stage authors often put info about the stage in these nodes. This
		program will display them read-only; you can edit them with BrawlBox.
	* If Options>Render Models is checked: the 3D models that make up the stage itself
	  * You can hide a particular texture by unchecking it in the Model Textures list
	  * Note: using "Preview All Models" in BrawlBox is another way to examine a stage
You can use Page Up and Page Down to go up and down the list,
even when it doesn't have focus.

Stage Manager can also perform certain operations on stage and .rel files:
	* Click on the button to automatically fix the .rel file's stage ID. This ID
	  has to match the stage you're replacing, or Brawl will freeze.
	  * You can also choose a stage ID manually (in case the automatic function
		doesn't work) by right-clicking the button and choosing "Change stage ID."
		The dialog for changing the ID is the same as in BrawlBox.
	* Right-click on the button to pull up a menu, which lets you delete the .pac
	  file or the .rel file. Windows will ask before deleting the file.
	* Drag and drop a .pac file onto the left-hand stage list to copy it to the
	  working directory. The program will ask what filename to save it as.
	* Drag and drop a .pac or .rel file onto the center information display to
	  replace the current .pac or .rel file. Windows will ask before overwriting.

The right sidebar will display (top to bottom):
	* Stage preview (MelSelmapPrevbase)
	* Stage icon (MenSelmapIcon)
	* "Repaint border" and "Generate name" buttons
	  (same as "[" and "]" buttons on keyboard)
	* Stage name (MenSelmapFrontStname)
	* Series icon (MenSelchrMark normally; SeriesIcon if using my
	  Classic Expansion Pack sc_selmap)
	* Game logo (MenSelmapMark)
	* A filesize bar that compares your sc_selmap size to the one in the game -
	  going over this limit could cause freezing at the stage select screen!
To replace one of these images, drag and drop an image file onto it. You can
also right-click on the image and choose Replace or Export.

All of these textures are looked up in the PAT0 entries in the common5, so
they will match the ones you see in-game. You can edit the PAT0 entries for
MenSelchrMark and MenSelmapMark using the Modify PAT0 button (or by pressing
the tilde (~) button on your keyboard.)

----------------------------------------

New in 3.0:
	* The custom SSS code is automatically read from RSBE01.gct if found
	  Uses for the custom SSS code:
	  * Mapping between stage IDs and icons
	  * Determining which stage icons to replace with an X on My Music (only
	    works if your common5 has a MenSelmapIcon.XX in it)
	  * Determining which icons to copy to the random stage chooser (in the
	    options menu)
	  * Stage sorting, if you choose to do so (replaces the old static list)
	* A crude picture of the stage can be used as the icon/portrait - look in
	  the Tools menu
	* Uses the newest BrawlLib
