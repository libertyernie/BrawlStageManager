Brawl Stage Manager is a program that uses BrawlLib to quickly view which
stages and module files are installed on your SD card (or in whatever folder,
on whatever device, you use for Brawl hacks.)

The left side of the window has a list of stage .PAC files in the current
directory; you can change the directory through the Options menu. Choosing a
stage file will display:
* Any MSBin nodes in the .pac file, starting with the last (shown by default)
  * Some stage authors, such as Mewtwo2000, often put info about the stage in
    these nodes. This program will display them read-only; you can edit them
    with BrawlBox.
* The filename, root node name, and filesize of the .PAC
* The filename, internal name, and filesize of the matching .rel file (if it exists)
  * By default, the program searches for .rel files in ../../module, but
    through the Options menu you can tell the program to search the current
    directory instead.
* The stage ID of the .rel file
  * This ID should match the ID of the stage you're replacing; if it doesn't,
    the button will turn red. (If the program doesn't know what ID your .rel
    file should have, the button will turn beige.)

Stage Manager can also perform certain operations on stage and .rel files:
* Click on the button to automatically fix the .rel file's stage ID. This ID
  has to match the stage you're replacing, or Brawl will freeze.
  * You can also choose a stage ID manually (in case the automatic function
    doesn't work) by right-clicking the button and choosing "Change stage ID."
    The dialog for changing the ID is the same as in BrawlBox.
* Right-click on the button to pull up a menu, which lets you delete the .pac
  file or the .rel file. Windows will ask before deleting the file.
* Drag and drop a .pac file onto the left-hand stage list to copy it to the
  working directory. The program will ask what filename to save it as.
* Drag and drop a .pac or .rel file onto the right-hand information display to
  replace the current .pac or .rel file. Windows will ask before overwriting.

Hint: In the "change directory" dialog, select your SD card and hit OK. If
there are no .pac files in the root of your SD card, the program should jump
to /private/wii/app/RSBE/pf/stage/melee instead (if it exists.) You can also
run BrawlStageManager.exe from the root of your SD card for the same effect.
