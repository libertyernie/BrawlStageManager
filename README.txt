This is the Git repository for Brawl Stage Manager and Brawl Song Manager. See the files BrawlStageManager.txt and BrawlSongManager.txt for more information.
Both projects are available under the MIT License. They also require BrawlLib (packaged with BrawlBox) which has its own, non-standard disclaimer.
