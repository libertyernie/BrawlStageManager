Brawl Song Manager is a program that uses BrawlLib to quickly view which BRSTM
music files are installed on your SD card (or in whatever folder, on whatever
device, you use for Brawl hacks.)

The left side of the window has a list of .BRSTM music files in the current
directory; you can change the directory through the File menu. When you choose
a .BRSTM file, the right side of the window will display the playback module
from BrawlBox, allowing you to listen to the song.

To replace a song, drag the new .BRSTM or .WAV onto the right panel.
To add a song, drag a .BRSTM or .WAV onto the left panel and enter a filename.
To delete a song, right-click the .BRSTM on the left panel and click "Delete."

----------------------------------------

If you have an info.pac file in ..\..\info2\info.pac, ..\..\info2\info_en.pac,
or .\info.pac, then the program will load that file and allow you to change
song titles (when applicable) - unless you have MiscData[140].msbin in the
current directory, in which case the program loads that instead. You can save
your changes through the File menu or by pressing Enter in the text box.
The "Restore" button resets the song title to the one loaded from info.pac,
while the "Default" button loads the default Brawl name for that slot.

If you have an info_training file, that will be updated as well. If song names
in the two files are different, the text box will be colored red.

Hint: In the "change directory" dialog, select your SD card and hit OK. If
there are no .brstm files in the root of your SD card, the program should jump
to /private/wii/app/RSBE/pf/sound/strm instead (if it exists.) You can also
run BrawlSongManager.exe from the root of your SD card for the same effect.
